## Bank Fraud Analysis ML Project

**Overview**

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection in the banking industry. The project encompasses data analysis, binary and multi-class model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation on testing data. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis, this project aims to equip financial institutions with the tools and insights needed to combat fraudulent activities effectively.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. It contains over 280,000 transactions, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions. The dataset includes a variety of features, such as transaction amount, transaction type, customer location, and device information.

**Methodology**

The project methodology is as follows:

* **Data analysis:** The dataset is thoroughly explored to gain insights into its structure, features, and distributions. This analysis provides a foundation for understanding the data, including its volume, quality, and potential sources of fraud.
* **Train-test split:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning models, while the testing set is reserved for evaluating the models' performance on unseen data.
* **Model development:** Various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines, are tested to develop binary and multi-class models for fraud detection.
* **Hyperparameter tuning:** The hyperparameters of the machine learning models are tuned to optimize their predictive capabilities.
* **Model evaluation:** The models are evaluated on the testing set to assess their performance in a real-world scenario.

**Results**

The project achieved the following results:

* **Binary classification models:** The binary classification models achieved an accuracy of over 99%, with a recall of over 95% and a precision of over 98%.
* **Multi-class classification model:** The multi-class classification model achieved an accuracy of over 95%, with a recall of over 90% and a precision of over 95%.

**Conclusion**

The results of this project demonstrate that machine learning can be effectively leveraged to develop robust fraud detection models for the banking industry. The models developed in this project can be used by financial institutions to identify and flag fraudulent transactions in real-time, thereby reducing financial losses and protecting their customers.

**Additional Information**

The repository also includes the following additional information:

* A scatter plot visualizing the distribution of the top three features that have the most significant impact on fraud detection.
* A detailed explanation of how Youden's J statistic is used to optimize the recall-precision trade-off for fraud detection.
* An analysis of the factors that contribute to the success of the multi-class model.

**Next Steps**

The next steps for this project include:

* Deploying the fraud detection models to a production environment.
* Developing a real-time fraud detection system that can flag fraudulent transactions as soon as they occur.
* Expanding the dataset to include more fraudulent transactions, which could further improve the performance of the models.
* Exploring other machine learning algorithms and techniques for fraud detection.
